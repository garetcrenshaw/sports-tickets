## Revenue Breakdown

### Parking ($19.00):
- Base: $19.00 ÷ 1.08625 = $17.50
- Tax: $1.50
- Stripe fee: $17.50 × 0.029 + $0.30 = $0.81
- Net: $17.50 - $0.81 = **$16.69**
- Business: $15.69
- Platform: $1.00 ✅

### Admission ($18.00):
- Base: $18.00 ÷ 1.08625 = $16.58
- Tax: $1.42
- Stripe fee: $16.58 × 0.029 + $0.30 = $0.78
- Net: $16.58 - $0.78 = **$15.80**
- Business: $14.80
- Platform: $1.00 ✅

### Total:
- **Business: $15.69 + $14.80 = $30.49** ✅ (Exceeds $30!)
