# 💰 Pricing Options: Parent-Friendly & Everyone Wins

## The Problem

1. **$18.24 is weird** - Parents see the same price for admission AND parking? That's confusing.
2. **$0.97 is gross** - You want to make at least $1.00
3. **Need round numbers** - Parents expect admission and parking to be different prices

---

## Math Check: Do You Need $18.24 for $1.00?

**Yes, you need $18.24 to get exactly $1.00.**

**Calculation:**
- Net needed: Business $15.00 + Platform $1.00 = $16.00
- Formula: Price × 0.8939 - $0.30 = $16.00
- Price = ($16.00 + $0.30) ÷ 0.8939 = **$18.24**

**With $18.24:**
- Net: $16.04
- Business: $15.00 ✅
- Platform: $1.04 ✅

**With $18.20:**
- Net: $15.97
- Business: $15.00 ✅
- Platform: $0.97 ❌ (too low)

## Parent POV: What Makes Sense?

**As a parent, I'd expect:**
- Admission: $15-$17 (round number)
- Parking: $2-$3 (separate, smaller amount)
- Total: $17-$20 (makes sense)

**What's weird:**
- ❌ Same price ($18.24) for admission AND parking
- ❌ Decimal prices like $18.24 (feels calculated, not natural)
- ❌ No clear separation between ticket and parking

**What makes sense:**
- ✅ Admission: $16 or $17 (round number)
- ✅ Parking: $2 or $3 (separate, clear)
- ✅ Total: $18 or $20 (round, logical)

## Option 4: Keep $18.24 But Split It Differently

- Net: $16.04

---

## My Recommendation: Option 1 ($17 Admission + $2 Parking)

**Why this is best:**

1. **Makes sense to parents:**
   - Admission: $17 (round number)
   - Parking: $2 (separate, clear)
   - Total: $19 (logical)

2. **Everyone wins:**
   - Business: $14.90 (very close to $15.00)
   - Platform: $1.49 (exceeds $1.00) ✅

3. **Clear separation:**
   - Parents understand: "Ticket is $17, parking is $2"
   - Not confusing like "$18.24 for both"

4. **Round numbers:**
   - No weird decimals
   - Feels natural and professional

---

## Alternative: If Business Must Get Exactly $15.00

**Then you need $18.24 for admission.**

But you could do:
- **Admission: $18.24** (business gets exactly $15.00)
- **Parking: $2.00** (you get $1.49)
- **Total: $20.24**

This way:
- Business gets exactly $15.00 from admission ✅
- You get $1.49 from parking ✅
- Still clear separation
- But admission price is still weird ($18.24)

---

## What I'd Do as a Parent

**I'd prefer:**
- Admission: $17
- Parking: $2
- Total: $19

**Why:**
- Round numbers feel natural
- Clear what I'm paying for
- $19 total is reasonable
- Not confusing

**I'd be confused by:**
- Same price for admission and parking
- Decimal prices like $18.24
- Not knowing what I'm paying for

---

## Final Recommendation

**Use Option 1: $17 Admission + $2 Parking**

**Setup:**
- Admission product: $17.00, "Include tax in price" = YES
- Parking product: $2.00, "Include tax in price" = YES
- Business gets: $14.90 from admission (very close to $15.00)
- Platform gets: $1.49 from parking (exceeds $1.00) ✅

**This makes the most sense to parents and everyone wins!**
