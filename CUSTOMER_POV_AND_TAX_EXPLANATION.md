# 👤 Customer POV & Tax Explanation

## Quick Answers

**With $18.24 All-In Pricing:**
```
SoCal Cup - General Admission    $18.24
──────────────────────────────────────

### 2. Who Pays Tax?

**THE CUSTOMER ALWAYS PAYS TAX.** This is California law.

- Tax is **not** something you (platform) pay
- Tax is **not** something the business pays
- Tax is **always** paid by the customer
- You're just collecting it for California

**You cannot split tax with the business** because:
- It's not your money - it belongs to California
- It's not a cost - it's a collection requirement
- The customer always pays it - you can't change this

---

### 3. What You CAN Split

**Net Revenue (after tax and Stripe fees):**
- Business gets: $15.00
- Platform gets: $1.05

This is what you're already doing! ✅
