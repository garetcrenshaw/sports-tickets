# 🏐 Youth Sports Pricing: What Makes Sense

## The Reality

**Event Structure:**
- 800 cars
- 2,000+ people
- People carpool (multiple people per car)

**Key Insight:**
- Parking is per CAR (one payment per car)
- Admission is per PERSON (one payment per person)
- These are SEPARATE purchases

**Financial Requirements:**
- Platform: $1 per car + $1 per person
- Business: $15 per person (admission)
- Business: $15 per car (parking) - **Is this required?**

---

## The Problem with Same Price

**If both are $18.24:**
- Parents see: "Admission $18.24" and "Parking $18.24"
- They think: "Why is parking the same price as admission?"
- Confusion: "Do I pay $18.24 for both? Or each?"

**This doesn't work for separate purchases!**

## Solution: Different Prices That Make Sense

### Option 1: $20 Admission + $15 Parking ✅ RECOMMENDED

**What customer sees:**
```
SoCal Cup - General Admission    $20.00
SoCal Cup - Parking Pass        $15.00
```

**Revenue:**
- Admission: Business $15.00, Platform $2.58
- Parking: Business $12.11, Platform $1.00

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Round numbers ($20, $15)
- ✅ Clear separation
- ✅ Makes sense: "Admission is $20, parking is $15"
- ✅ Platform gets $1.00 per car + $2.58 per person
- ✅ Business gets $15.00 per person

**Explanation:**
- "Admission is $20 per person"
- "Parking is $15 per car (carpool to save!)"
- "If 4 people carpool, that's $20×4 + $15 = $95 total"

---

### Option 2: $18 Admission + $12 Parking

**What customer sees:**
```
SoCal Cup - General Admission    $18.00
SoCal Cup - Parking Pass        $12.00
```

**Revenue:**
- Admission: Business $14.90, Platform $1.68
- Parking: Business $9.64, Platform $1.00

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Round numbers ($18, $12)
- ✅ Clear separation
- ✅ Lower total ($30 vs $35)

**But:**
- Business gets $14.90 per person (not exactly $15.00)
- Business gets $9.64 per car (not $15.00)

---

### Option 3: $20 Admission + $10 Parking

**What customer sees:**
```
SoCal Cup - General Admission    $20.00
SoCal Cup - Parking Pass        $10.00
```

**Revenue:**
- Admission: Business $15.00, Platform $2.58
- Parking: Business $7.64, Platform $1.00

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Round numbers ($20, $10, $30)
- ✅ Clear separation
- ✅ Platform gets $1.00 per car + $2.58 per person
- ✅ Business gets $15.00 per person

**But:**
- Business only gets $7.64 per car (not $15.00)

---

## The Key Question

**Does the business need exactly $15 per car for parking?**

**If YES:**
- You're stuck with $18.24 for parking
- And $18.24 for admission
- Same price = confusing for separate purchases

**If NO (business can accept less per car):**
- Use $20 admission + $15 parking
- Makes logical sense
- Round numbers
- Clear separation

---

## My Strong Recommendation

**Use $20 Admission + $15 Parking**

**Why:**
1. ✅ Round numbers (no decimals)
2. ✅ Clear separation (admission vs parking)
3. ✅ Makes logical sense to parents
4. ✅ Platform gets $1.00 per car + $2.58 per person
5. ✅ Business gets $15.00 per person + $12.11 per car

**Explanation to parents:**
- "Admission is $20 per person"
- "Parking is $15 per car"
- "Carpool to save! 4 people = $20×4 + $15 = $95"

**This is the most logical and parent-friendly option!**

---

## If Business MUST Get $15 Per Car

Then you need to explain:
- "All-inclusive pricing: $18.24 covers admission and parking"
- "One price, no hidden fees"
- "Same price for both makes it simple"

**But this is still confusing because they're separate purchases...**

---

## What Should We Do?

**Tell me:**
1. Does business need exactly $15 per car for parking?
2. Or can they accept less (like $12.11)?

**Then I'll set up the best option!** 🚀
