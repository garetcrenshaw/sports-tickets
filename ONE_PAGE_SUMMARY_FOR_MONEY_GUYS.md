──────────────────────────────────────

**Note:** Tax is shown separately (required by California law)

## Why $17.00 Works (But Only This Way)

**✅ CORRECT: Tax shown separately**
- Price: $17.00
- Tax: $1.47 (added on top)
- Net: $16.21
- Business: $15.00 ✅
- Platform: $1.21 ✅

**❌ WRONG: Tax included in price**
- Price: $17.00 (includes tax)
- Net: $14.91
- Business: $14.91 ❌ (Not enough!)

---

## What Needs to Be Configured

### Stripe Dashboard
- Price: **$17.00**
- "Include tax in price": **NO** ✅

### Why "NO"?
- Shows tax separately (required for $17.00 to work)
- If "YES", you won't have enough money after tax

---

## Bottom Line

**$17.00 works perfectly** as long as tax is shown separately.

- Customer pays: $18.47 total
- Business gets: $15.00 ✅
- Platform gets: $1.21 ✅
- California compliant ✅
- Everyone is happy! 🎉

## Key Takeaway

**Taxes and Stripe fees are SEPARATE costs that don't go to you.**

The net revenue ($16.21) is what you actually keep and split between business and platform.
